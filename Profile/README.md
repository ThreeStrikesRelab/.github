# ThreeStrikesRelab
> Write it wrong. Write it right. Refactor.

## How ?
- Start red, go green, clean it up.
- Code is a living thing, shape it as you go.
- Learn by doing, breaking, fixing, and doing again.
- Projects here are designed to be forked, remixed, and improved together.

> The third time, you refactor."
